Repositories to store rograms and scripts so that i can get to them from all varous systems.
I am starting to reuse varous scripts, and they are always on the wrong system, so a common store is needed now.
Hoping to provide better structure to the mass of programs i am creating.
Most of this is beginner stuff using python for ML and building things for use with circuitpython and micropython.
The python here is not always to most "pythonic" but i write programs, first to get the idea out and working, 
then go back and improve them, to move from functional or OOP as needed.
I hope that one day my brain will just think in python/OOP to start....
